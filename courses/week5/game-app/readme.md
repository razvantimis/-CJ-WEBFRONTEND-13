Implement “play” function that is a “Rock, paper, scissors” game.

Implementations notes:

­ - Create an array with all the possibilities (rock, paper, scissors);

­ - Pick a random option for Computer ( use Math.random);

­ - Pick a random option for User ( use Math.random);

­ - Apply game rules for both options (use if/else if structures)

Calling “play()” function will display in console something like this:
Computer choice: “Rock”
User choice: “Paper”
User wins!
